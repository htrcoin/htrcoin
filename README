****
HTRC includes an Address Index feature, based on the address index API (searchrawtransactions RPC command) implemented in Bitcoin Core but modified the implementation to work with the HTRC codebase (PoS coins maintain a txindex by default for instance).

Initialize the Address Index By Running with -reindexaddr Command Line Argument.  It may take 10-15 minutes to build the initial index.

HTRC is dependent upon libsecp256k1 by sipa, the sources for which can be found here:
